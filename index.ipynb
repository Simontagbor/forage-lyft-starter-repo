    "<p>I used a combination of design patterns and object-oriented program design principles to sanitize the codebase. The thought process behind the design choices is further discussed below:</p>\n",

    "<div class=\"accordion-body\">\n",
    "<strong class=\"text-secondary\">Strategy Design Pattern</strong>\n",
    "<p>This design pattern choice felt more natural for instances where we will be handling different vehicles with unique algorithms for determining servicing needs. A typical strategy design pattern approach would involve creating a <code>Serviceable</code> interface - an abstract class of anything that can be serviced with a <code>needs_service</code> abstract method. Different <code>Car</code> subclasses of the interface would then encapsulate their own <code>needs_service</code> algorithms for determining when its instances should be serviced.</p>\n",
    "<p>The strategy design pattern makes it more straightforward to add new vehicles and it also ensures that each new <code>Car</code> variant has its own <em><strong>strategy</strong></em> for determining servicing needs implemented. For instance, LYFT may decide in the future to add a <code>Motorbike</code> and <code>Segway</code> to its fleet. The <code>Serviceable</code> interface makes it easier to extend the codebase to meet the new requirements with fewer breaking changes.

    "<div class=\"accordion-body\">\n",
    "<strong class=\"text-secondary\">Factory Design Pattern</strong>\n",
    "<p>Considering that our fleet management system will be instantiating several vehicle types across the codebase, it will be helpful to use a <a href=\"https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns/creational_patterns\">creational design parttern</a> to organize the logic of how vehicles in the fleet get created in one place. Similar to other creational design patterns, the factory design pattern attempts to encapsulate the logic for creating variants of <code>Car</code> instances in one well-defined <code>CarFactory</code> class interface.</p>\n",
    "<p>This approach abstracts how a <code>Car</code> instance gets created, making it possible to isolate the client from having to know how the instances get \"assembled\". For example, if the specification requires that a <code>Calliope</code> car object should have a particular <code>Engine</code>, <code>Battery</code> and <code>Tire</code> components, the <code>CarFactory</code> interface will provide a <code>.create_calliope_car(...)</code> public method that puts the right components together and returns a calliope car object to the client. \n",
    "<p>The factory design pattern allows for a much cleaner codebase and any problem with our object creation logic can be easily isolated during debugging because now the creation of objects is independent of the client that uses them. you can learn more about the Factory Design Pattern <a href=\"https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/factory-method\">here</a></p>\n",

    "<strong class=\"text-secondary\">Composition Over Inheritance</strong>\n",
    "<p>I used the design principle of \"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composition_over_inheritance\">composition over inheritance</a>\" to address the pain point of complex and deep inheritance hierarchy in the codebase. In the current design, components are too tightly coupled making the codebase less modular. favoring composition - where we create a complete unit of components(<em>also known as composites</em>) that are independent of other components and assign them as attributes of a class that depends on them.</p>\n",
    "<p>For example cars in LYFT's fleet will need <em>to have</em> <code>Engine</code> and <code>Battery</code> components to determine servicing needs. The inheritance approach would be to let the <code>Car</code> class subclass <code>Engine</code> and <code>Battery</code> classes. This way, the car instances would have all the attributes they need to determine servicing needs. This approach is not only error-prone, it also results in duplicated code. \n",
    "<p>With composition, we simply treat <code>Engine</code> and <code>Battery</code> as independent classes that can be used by other classes as shown by the <code>Car</code> class below:</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import Engine\n",
    "import Battery\n",
    "\n",
    "class Car(Serviceable):\n",
    "    ....\n",
    "    def __init__(self, engine: Engine, battery: Battery):\n",
    "        self.engine = engine \n",
    "        self.battery = battery\n",
    "```\n",
    "<p>For our use case, not only does choosing to favor composition over inheritance make the codebase more modular, but it also makes the design more intuitive as it models the real-world relationships between a car and its components. It feels more natural to say a Car <em><strong>HAS  A</strong></em> Battery and an Engine than it is to say a Car <em><strong>IS A </strong></em>Battery and an Engine combined.

    "### 3. Extensive Unit testing of the Codebase\n",
    "I wrote unit tests to test the new codebase. The unit tests are located in the `test` directory. The unittests cover the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "<ul class=\"list-group\">\n",
    "<li class=\"list-group-item d-flex justify-content-between align-items-center\">\n",
    "Test the creation of different types of vehicles.\n",
    "<span>✅</span>\n",
    "</li>\n",
    "<li class=\"list-group-item d-flex justify-content-between align-items-center\">\n",
    "Test the creation of different types of engines.\n",
    "<span>✅</span>\n",
    "</li>\n",
    "<li class=\"list-group-item d-flex justify-content-between align-items-center\">\n",
    "Test the creation of different types of batteries.\n",
    "<span>✅</span>\n",
    "</li>\n",
    "<li class=\"list-group-item d-flex justify-content-between align-items-center\">\n",

    "<li class=\"list-group-item d-flex justify-content-between align-items-center\">\n",
    "Test that the Base Engine and Base Battery classes are correctly implemented.\n",
    "<span>✅</span>\n",
    "</li>\n",
    "<li class=\"list-group-item d-flex justify-content-between align-items-center\">\n",
    "Test that the derived classes from the Base Engine and Base Battery classes are correctly implemented.\n",

    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Testing Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>I mostly wrote standard unit tests, however, in some cases I used `@patch`decorator to mock the creation of different types of vehicles, engines, and batteries using the `Factory Method Pattern`- Implemented Via the `car_factory.py` module.\n",
    "I did that to ensure that the tests are independent of the client that uses them.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Mocking the creation of objects allowed me to focus on testing the functionality of the code in isolation, without relying on the specific details of the instantiated objects.</p>\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "<li>\n",
    "<p><strong>Design Patterns</strong>: I learned about different design patterns such as the Factory Method Pattern and Strategy Pattern. I learned how to use these patterns to create a more scalable and maintainable codebase. I will always have it in mind that different design patterns can be used to solve different problems and understanding the problem domain is key to choosing the right design pattern.</P>\n",
    "</li>\n",
    "<li>\n",
    "<p><strong>Test-Driven Development (TDD)</strong>: having known about the concept for a while, I finally got to use it in my workflow as a developer. I saw firsthand that TDD is a great way to ensure that the code is working as expected and to catch bugs early in the development process.</p>\n",
    "</li>\n",
    "<li>\n",
    "<p><strong>Unit Testing</strong>: I reinforced my understanding of unit testing techniques and I am now committed to writing extensive unit tests in future projects. I also learned how to use the <code>@patch</code> decorator from the <code>unittest</code> module to mock the creation of objects. I also discovered a neat way to measure the coverage of tests inside the codebase using the <code>coverage</code> package.</p>\n",
